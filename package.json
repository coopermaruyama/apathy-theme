Includes custom bundled fonts with multiple font-weights, **antialiased font smoothing** for clean rendering of text, and tons of other features!\n\n# README before customizing colors!\n* First I'd like to mention that the intention for the adjustable colors was not for changing the hue, but rather the lightness or saturation in order to counter-act differences between color profiles and calibrations of monitors.\n* Technically, overriding the LESS variables of a theme is not supported by atom (see [#5903](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5903)). The solution in place is VERY hacky and causes errors if not done correctly. Without getting into the details, it looks like Atom had worked on this and then were not able to get it implemented, so the way it's working in this theme is that it's actually writing your custom settings into a file within the package every time you change the values.\n  Also, when you change the values, the UI theme won't read the changes because it's already compiled LESS to CSS! So you have to live reload (`ctrl+alt+cmd+L`) _every_ time you change a color setting. Note that this will persist through updates fine since the settinsg are stored in your own config, but it's a hassle.\n  \n* If you want to go back to default, open your config (File > Open your config) and delete the color stuff under the 'apathy-theme' key.",
